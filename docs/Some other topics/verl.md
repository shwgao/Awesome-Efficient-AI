# Verl 

verl is an open source implementation of the paper [HybridFlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19256v2) and [code](https://github.com/volcengine/verl). verl is a flexible and efficient RLHF library for LLMs.

verl represents RLHF as a dataflow graph. Take the PPO algorithm as an example, the dataflow graph is shown in the following figure.
